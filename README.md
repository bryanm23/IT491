# Designing a network to protect against and mitigate ransomware attacks.

Our project focuses on enhancing network security to mitigate ransomware threats through effective network segmentation. By dividing a network into smaller, isolated segments and implementing strategies like VLANs and DMZ protections, we aimed to limit ransomware spread, safeguard sensitive data, and strengthen defenses. Using Cisco Packet Tracer, we designed, tested, and refined a segmented network to demonstrate the containment of ransomware and improve overall organizational resilience.
